## Research Questions

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is a popular open source version control system that makes life just
so much easier.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
While Git is an open source version control sytem, GitHub is a cloud based
hosting service that helps you to manage your Git repositories.

3. Why do we create a branch?
We create branches for use with Git's version control, they help us to keep
track of changes and allow for many people to work on the same project
with out interfering with eachother and without changing the main parent code
until you are ready.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
Pull requests allow you to look over and review changes you have made to a 
branch in contrast to the main.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
The 'git checkout' command allows for swaping between branches

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch allows for the download of commits, files, and refs from remote repositorys to your local repo.
git merge allows for the combination of two branches, combining the commits of both into a singular history.
git pull will also download content from a remote repository, however git pull will automatically update your local repo
to match the content installed.
7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when changes are either made to the same line of a file or changes are made to a file in one branch
and that same file was deleted in another, resulting in the two branches being incompatible until the merge conflict is
resolved
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
The simple way would be to open the files find the poin/points of issue and resolve them to make the files compatible.
